#### Instructions

Set up a Zoom video conference and share your screen. Create two teams, the koalas and the dolphins. The game is designed that both teams to have adults and little kids (2-5 year-olds). The koalas go first. Begin by clicking the "Roll" button to roll the die. Then click the "Question" button. If you get your question right, move the amount you rolled. If not, stay where you are. Hover the board to see icons in each segment. To move, click an icon to show and hide it. For images, clicking on the image will enlarge it. Have fun!
