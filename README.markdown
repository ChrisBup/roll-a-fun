#### Instructions

Create two teams, the koalas and the dolphins. The game is designed that both teams have adults and little kids (two- and three-year-olds since that's what my family currently has). The koalas go first. Begin by clicking the "Roll" button to roll the die. Then click the "Question" button. If you get your question right, move the amount you rolled. If not, stay where you are. For images, clicking on the image will enlarge it. Have fun!
